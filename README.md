# sortingVisualizer
The objective of this project is to visualize various important sorting algorithms such as
* BubbleSort
* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort
* QuickSort

I plan to implement more as well. I also have Merge Sort in there, but have not been able to visualize it yet as it requires creating additional arrrays.

I designed and implemented the algorithms in JavaScript and used the p5.js library to assist in setting up a canvas upon which the array is represented by vertical bars of varying height.
From there, p5.js has a draw function which continuously executes lines of code that animate the vertical bars moving to visualize the sorting algorithms as they take place. There are also various colors applied to the bars at different parts of the algorithm's execution. There are buttons to begin each sorting algorithm and also a button to reset the array/generate a new one. Currently, I suggest opening the index.html file with the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code; however, I plan to setup a Github Pages for this repository for easier interaction.
