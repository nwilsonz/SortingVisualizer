# sortingVisualizer
The objective of this project is to visualize various important sorting algorithms such as
* BubbleSort
* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort
* QuickSort

I plan to implement more as well. I also have Merge Sort in there as well, but have not been able to visualize it yet.

I designed and implemented the algorithms in JavaScript and used the p5.js library to assist in setting up a canvas upon which the array is represented by vertical bars of varying height.
From there, p5.js has a draw() function which continuously executes lines of code that animate the vertical bars moving to visualize the sorting algorithms as they take place. Currently, I suggest
opening the index.html file with the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
